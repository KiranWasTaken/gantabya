# Techniques

Based on the search results provided, the following algorithms are relevant to optimizing travel itineraries and costs:

## Genetic Algorithms
    They are used for optimizing the itinerary by considering factors like cost, time, user preferences, and sustainability. They are effective but have a time complexity of O(g.p.f), where g is the number of generations, p is the population size, and f is the complexity of the fitness function.

## Greedy Heuristics
    These are used for sustainability checking and can be applied to select travel options with the lowest possible carbon footprint iteratively. They are efficient and easy to implement but may not guarantee the globally optimal solution and are inflexible in complicated situations. The Greedy Heuristic functions with a sorting time of O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for selection making it suitable for real-time applications that require instantaneous decision making.

## Machine Learning Models
    These are used for both cost forecasting and personalization, enabling real-time, multi-disciplinary optimization. They process large volumes of data and recommend itineraries that address the various travel goals of the traveler, i.e., preference, budget, time, and sustainability.

## Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
    This is used for computing the optimal route for public transport with minimum travel time and cost.

## AI Algorithms
    These can analyze large volumes of data to discover patterns and predict areas where airlines may publish low fares, making it easier for passengers to access cheap routes and accommodation.

The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the travel optimization problem.
